    "### 1.1 Scenario and  Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose is to search for a house for rent in the Canadian city of Vancouver. This house must meet certain requirements regarding the location of the same, environment, places of interest, proximity to means of transport.\n",
    "It is not a matter of making a comparison with another city in the world, but rather seeks to meet the minimum requirements of a target client.\n",
    "Although this problem could be solved simply by making use of the professional services of a real estate agent, all the techniques and knowledge acquired in the course of IBM will be applied.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2  Problem to be resolved:   \n",
    "\n",
    "As detailed in the previous section, you must search for a home in the city of Vancouver. The home must meet the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Must be in a neighborhood of the city with a family atmosphere.\n",
    "- In the environment there must be parks to walk and play sports.\n",
    "- It must be close to public transportation.\n",
    "- There must be a sports offer in the vicinity.\n",
    "- The area should be easily accessible by road.\n",
    "- It must be located next to ski areas.\n",
    "- The catering offer must be rich, coffee shops and restaurants must be in the immediate vicinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Interested Audience:\n",
    "\n",
    "The audience interested in this project is a supposed target customer who must change his place of residence from a European capital, to the city of Vancouver. This is a manager of a multinational company with a high purchasing power and that has no economic limitations in terms of the rental price of the home in question since the cost of such rent will be borne by the company for which he works.\n",
    "The requirements on the location of the home seek to find an environment similar to the current place of residence of the client."

    "- Information about the neighborhoods of the city with their geographic location data.\n",
